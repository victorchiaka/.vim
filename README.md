## My Vim setup

**I made this setup with python in mind, i'm using `CoC` as the language server, so i can extend it when i need.**

Install language servers using coc-`<your-desired-language-server->`

----------
**How to install**

Install fzf using whatever package manager you are comfortable with in your operating system

Clone the repo into your `$HOME` (for mac or linux)

Open the vim and run `PluginInstall` to install everything in vundle

----------
For wakatime integration to track the time you spend coding **Run**: `:WakaTimeApiKey`

Enter your API key and you're set to go.
